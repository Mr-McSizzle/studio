Measure your Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) per channel.`;

1.  **Early Adopter Program:** Offer exclusive access or discounts to a select group of users in your '${targetMarketDescription || 'audience'}' in exchange for feedback. Promote this through targeted outreach or niche communities.
2.  **Problem/Solution Content Series:** Create a series of short articles or videos highlighting a key pain point for '${targetMarketDescription || 'your audience'}' and how your product solves it. Share these across relevant social channels.
Remember to define clear goals and KPIs for any campaign.`;

- **Content Marketing:** SEO-optimized blog posts, helpful guides, or case studies to build organic reach.
- **Targeted Digital Ads:** Platforms like LinkedIn (for B2B) or Facebook/Instagram (for B2C) allow precise targeting of '${targetMarketDescription || 'your audience'}'. Start with small test budgets to find what works.
- **Influencer/Community Collaborations:** If your product fits, partnering with relevant micro-influencers or active members in communities frequented by '${targetMarketDescription || 'your audience'}' can be effective.
Always track your Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) per channel to optimize spend.`;

- **Early Stage (Idea/MVP):** Focus on cost-effective channels (content, organic social, community engagement) and validating your messaging. Spend should be minimal and focused on learning.
- **Growth Stage:** As you understand your CAC and LTV (Lifetime Value), you can scale spend more confidently on proven channels. A/B testing different spend levels on various platforms can yield valuable insights.
Consider allocating a small percentage (e.g., 10-15%) of your budget for experimental channels.`;
