Consistency and engagement are key. A ${safeBrandVoice} brand voice will help you stand out. Consider a content calendar with themes like 'Behind-the-Scenes Tuesdays', 'User-Generated Fridays', and 'Educational Mondays'. A sample post could be: "Ever wonder how '${safeProductName}' helps '${safeTargetAudience}' achieve [Key Benefit]? We're pulling back the curtain! #BehindTheScenes #[ProductName] #[IndustryInsight]"`;

Platforms like Facebook/Instagram and LinkedIn offer robust targeting. Track your ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) closely. For '${safeProductName}', an initial test budget of $500-$1000 on a key platform could provide initial data. A sample ad copy: "Tired of [Pain Point]? Discover how '${safeProductName}' empowers '${safeTargetAudience}' to [Achieve Goal]. Limited-time offer! Learn more. #[AdCopy] #[TargetedHashtag]"`;

Theme: 'Empowering ${safeTargetAudience} with ${safeProductName}'
Key Message: 'Experience [Key Benefit 1] and [Key Benefit 2] with the simplicity of ${safeProductName}.'
Platform Example (Instagram):
  Visual: A vibrant flat lay of '${safeProductName}' surrounded by items representing the '${safeTargetAudience}' lifestyle or a short, engaging video demonstrating its use.
  Caption: "ðŸš€ Unlock [Major Benefit] with ${safeProductName}! We're making it easier than ever for the modern '${safeTargetAudience}' to [Solve Problem/Achieve Goal]. What will YOU create? âœ¨ #[${productName ? productName.replace(/\s+/g, '') : 'Startup'}] #[${brandVoice ? brandVoice.replace(/\s+/g, '') : 'Innovation'}] #[RelevantTrend]"
  Call to Action: 'Learn More & Join the Movement!' or 'Get Early Access to ${safeProductName}!'
This is a conceptual sketch, of course! We can refine it.`;

      advice += `Predicting virality is challenging! For '${safeProductName}', factors like emotional appeal (humor, inspiration, surprise), timeliness, uniqueness, and ease of sharing are crucial. A campaign targeting '${safeTargetAudience}' with a ${safeBrandVoice} and authentic style has a moderate chance if it taps into a current trend, is visually engaging, and includes a clear call-to-share. High production value isn't always necessary, but relatability often is. For instance, a user-generated content contest focusing on authentic experiences with '${safeProductName}' could gain traction.`;

      advice += `To make a splash on social media for '${safeProductName}', we need to deeply understand your '${safeTargetAudience}', choose the right platforms where they hang out, create genuinely engaging content that speaks their language (using your ${safeBrandVoice} brand voice), and be consistently present. What specific aspect of social media are you curious about today? Organic growth, paid campaigns, influencer marketing, or something else? For example, a simple, engaging question post for your target audience could be: "Hey '${safeTargetAudience}', what's your biggest challenge when it comes to [Related Topic]? We're building '${safeProductName}' to help! #Feedback #[Community]"`;
